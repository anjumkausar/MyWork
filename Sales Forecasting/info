BUSINESS PROBLEM:
A steel manufacturer seeks to enhance its strategic planning and operational efficiency by accurately forecasting quarterly sales to its 75 business customers across various industries such as Auto, Metal Fabrication, and Infrastructure. Utilizing a dataset comprising 8 quarters of sales data and relevant economic indicators, the challenge is to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting next quarter’s sales for each customer. This project aims to minimize the mean absolute error between the predicted and actual sales, enabling the manufacturer to better align production schedules, manage inventory, and optimize resource allocation.
DATA: 
The dataset for the capstone project consists of synthetic and real-world data provided by a steel manufacturer. The data encompasses 8 quarters of sales transactions with 75 distinct customers, offering a comprehensive view of the company’s sales dynamics over time.
Dataset Composition:
Quarterly Sales Data (Company-Specific): This component of the dataset details the sales transactions between the steel manufacturer and it’s 75 customers across 8 quarters. It included essential sales metrics, which are the primary focus of the forecasting models developed in this project.
Monthly Economic Data (General Data): To complement the sales data, the dataset includes general economic indicators on a monthly basis. This includes a regional economic activity index and a national economic activity index, which provide insights into the broader economic context affecting sales performances.
APPROACH: 
The approach involved a comprehensive analysis and modelling strategy, iteratively refined through multiple submissions. The process involved data preparation, feature engineering, model experimentation, and evaluation. Each phase contributed to developing a robust predictive model aimed at minimizing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of quarterly sales forecasts to 75 business customers.
